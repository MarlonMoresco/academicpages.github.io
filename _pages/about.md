I am a postdoctoral fellow at Concordia University under Professors [Melina Mailhot](https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/melina-mailhot.html) and [Silvana Pesenti](https://utstat.toronto.edu/pesenti/). Currently working on roubust risk measures and risk measurament for natural catastrophe insurance.

From 2019 to 2022, I was a Ph.D. canditade in Finance from Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. I also have a BSc and a MSc in business. My research interest is maily on the axiomatic approach for risk measures.
